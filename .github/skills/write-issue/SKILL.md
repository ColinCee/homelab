# Writing Issues for Agent Implementation

An issue is a contract: define the destination, not the route. The agent can read the codebase, follow conventions, and run CI — your job is to tell it what problem to solve and how to know it's solved.

## The 4 essential sections

### 1. What's wrong

Current behavior and why it's a problem. Be specific about the gap.

> The fix loop uses a separate CLI session that starts cold — it re-reads the entire codebase without knowing WHY the original code was written that way. This is like handing code to a different developer for fixes.

Not: "The fix loop needs improvement."

### 2. What done looks like

Observable, testable success criteria. If the agent can't verify it with `mise run ci` or by checking behavior, it's not concrete enough.

> A single `/implement` call owns the full lifecycle: implement → review → fix → re-review, looping until clean or capped at 3 iterations. The implementor session is resumed for fixes. The reviewer is always a fresh session.

Not: "Make the implement flow better."

### 3. What the agent can't discover

Research findings, external API behavior, confirmed feasibility — things that require experimentation or access the agent won't have. Don't include things discoverable by reading the codebase.

> CLI session resumption is confirmed working: `copilot --resume=<id> -p "prompt"` in headless mode preserves ~68k cached tokens. Session ID is captured via `--share`.

Not: "The codebase uses FastAPI and has these 5 files..."

### 4. What must not break

Blast radius boundaries. The agent is good at making changes but needs to know which existing behavior is sacred.

> `/review` must continue to work independently for human-triggered reviews. Accumulated premium_requests must still be accurate for metrics.

## Labels

Apply labels when creating or updating issues:

| Label | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `agent` | Triggers autonomous implementation. Add when the issue is ready for the bot. |
| `agent-failed` | Agent tried but couldn't complete. Needs human attention or a rewritten issue. |
| `priority/high` | Actively blocking or degrading agent reliability. Work on these first. |
| `priority/low` | Backlog — nice to have, no urgency. |
| `bug` | Something is broken. |
| `enhancement` | New feature or improvement. |
| `documentation` | Docs-only change. |

## Triggering implementation

After creating the issue, trigger the bot by commenting `/implement` on the issue or adding the `agent` label. The `implement.yaml` workflow dispatches to the agent service.

GitHub only auto-closes the issue on merge when the PR body uses a closing
keyword such as `Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, or `Resolves #N`. `Implements #N` is
descriptive only.

## Critical: everything goes in the body

The implement bot only receives the issue **title and body**. It never sees issue comments, reactions, or linked PRs. All context, requirements, and constraints must be in the body itself. If you add information in a comment, the agent will never see it — rewrite the body instead.

## What to omit

- **File lists and function signatures** — the agent explores the codebase itself
- **Implementation order** — the agent handles dependency ordering
- **How to test** — the agent has `mise run ci` and testing conventions
- **Codebase structure** — the agent can read it; instructions and skills cover conventions
